## A Weather Dashboard
Enter a city into the search bar and see current weather conditions for that area as well as a 5-day forecast. 

When a city is entered it is saved to local storage so that they can be viewed if the user refreshes the page or closes it and reopens it later. 

This website uses the openweather api to return weather conditions based on the geographical location of the city that was entered by the user.

### Current Issues
- Future dates are not shown in the 5-day forecast
- 5-day forecasts are added below previouse forecasts instead of replacing the previous search
- City buttons do not work to search previous cities again
- Some weather information missing (not found in the data object returned by th api)
- Clear search button
